== What is this?

It is set of pages which everyone can edit.
Go to the page which you want to change and press "edit",
the writing form appears.
The writing form is
((<RD format|URL:http://www2.pos.to/~tosh/ruby/rdtool/en/whats.html>)).

Feel free to edit the temporarily ((<TEST>)) page.

== How should I do to make a new page?

(1) Press "edit" at somewhere on an existing page.
(2) Add (('((<Page Name>))')) at somewhere in the page and preserve it
    ((-Page Name does not have to be a WikiName.-)).

You see the added part as a link to a new page.
You can edit the page as well as other pages.

== Do when someone erases my comment?

Please give it up. It is as such.
